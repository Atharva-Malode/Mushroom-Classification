# **Mushroom Classification**

This repository contains a machine learning model trained to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on certain features. The model is implemented using a decision tree algorithm.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of samples of mushrooms, where each sample is characterized by the following input features:
- Gill Size
- Gill Color
- Stalk Root
- Spore Print Color
- Population

The target variable is the classification of the mushroom as either **"edible"** or **"poisonous"**.
